# notebooks
My plan is to use this repo to build an expanding collection IPython Notebooks (and occasionally other code files) as I work through various finance, statistics, machine learning or any other resources that catch my interest.  While some notebooks will contain only notes, I expect most will contain a mix of notes and supporting code examples as I tend to learn these topics best by working through code.  I am hoping that by making this a public repository it will keep me focused and diligent, and perhaps provide some useful resources for anyone else working through the same interesting subject matter.
